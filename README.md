# Ordered List C++ Implementation

A lightweight C++ library for managing ordered lists with automatic sorting capabilities.

## Features

- Template-based implementation supporting all numeric types
- Automatic sorting of elements upon insertion
- Protected member access for easy inheritance
- Built-in error handling for invalid operations

## Implementation Details

The library uses a template-based approach with a Numeric concept to ensure type safety. It includes optimized sorting algorithms and inherits from a base list implementation for enhanced functionality.

## Usage Example

```
MyOrderedList<int> list;
list.add(5);  // Automatically maintains order
list.add(3);  // Elements are sorted
list.add(7);  // No manual sorting needed
```
